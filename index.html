                <h2 class="section_title">About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Chris, and I am a full stack web developer. I love coding because of its many fascinating interdisciplinary applications, as it can be applied to any field or discipline to solve many of our problems.
                        I was first exposed to coding after hearing <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/08/09/749938354/episode-932-deep-learning-with-the-elephants" target="_blank"><span>this NPR podcast</span></a> about 
                        how computer science is being used to save elephants, and since I started learning I have never looked back!
                        I love the rewarding feeling of seeing my programs and apps come alive with the code that I write. I also love working on engineering, development, and non-technical teams with like-minded, passionate people.
                        Iâ€™m especially interested in how software engineering and computer science can address and solve challenges in sustainability, renewable energy, and environmental conservation</p><br>
                        <p>I am a graduate of Tufts University with a double major in Environmental Science and International Relations, and I'm a student of Bloc's Fullstack Engineer Program.
                        Outside of coding, I love hiking, yoga, reading non-fiction (especially books by Bill Bryson and Michael Pollan), baking breads and sweets, 
                        and playing guitar (I mostly play classical and Spanish guitar, but I also love the Grateful Dead and the Beatles).

                                <p>Inspired by the Passport to your National Parks, the National Parks Discover-E-Pass is a program to "stamp" every national park, monument, and historic site that you have ever attended or wish to attend.
                                I built this because I own a National Parks Passport, I wanted to pay tribute to those who work to hard to preserve the 490+ environmental and historic wonders which make up the National Parks System.
                                The Naitonal Parks Discover-E-Pass is a program that aims to inspire others to explore the many national parks and hopefully visit them all.
                                It is a fullstack program made with React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and CSS.

                                Bearfoot is a program designed to find hiking trails near you. Just enter your address, town, zip code, or 
                                coordiantes to explore different green spaces anywhere in the United States. I made Bearfoot because, wherever you are in the United States, you are always close to green space or to the great outdoors, 
                                and this program is perfect for those who love hiking and the outdoors as much as I do. This program was made with Javascript, jQuery, Restful APIs, HTML5, and CSS.

                                    I was inpired to make this program I saw a "Name That Car Logo" catagory on Jeopardy where I couldn't name a single one, and the result of that embaressment was the Car Logo Quiz.
                                    This program is for anyone who is interested in learning more about car logos and how many different brands there really are.
