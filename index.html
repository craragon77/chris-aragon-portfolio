            <h1>Chris Aragon</h1>
            <p>My name is Chris, and I am a full stack web developer. I love coding because of its many fascinating interdisciplinary applications, as it can be applied to any field or discipline to solve many of our problems.
                    I was first exposed to coding after hearing this NPR podcast about how computer science is being used to save elephants, and since I started learning I have never looked back!
                    I love the rewarding feeling of seeing my programs and apps come alive with the code that I write. Iâ€™m especially interested in front-end website development and how to visually represent complex concepts or data.
                    I am a graduate of Tufts University with a double major in Environmental Science and International Relations.
                    Outside of coding, I love hiking, yoga, reading non-fiction (especially books by Bill Bryson and Michael Pollan), baking breads and sweets, 
                    and playing guitar (I mostly play classical, but I also love the Grateful Dead and the Beatles).
            </p>
