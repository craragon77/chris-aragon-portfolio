                <h2 class="section_title">About Me</h2>
                    <p>I was first exposed to coding after hearing <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/08/09/749938354/episode-932-deep-learning-with-the-elephants" target="_blank"><span>this NPR podcast</span></a> about 
                        how computer science is being used to save elephants in the wild, and since I started learning programming I have never looked back! I love coding because of its many fascinating interdisciplinary applications, as well as 
                        the rewarding feeling of seeing my programs and apps come alive with the code that I wrote. I also enjoy working on engineering, development, and non-technical teams with like-minded, passionate people.
                        Iâ€™m especially interested in how software engineering and computer science can address and solve challenges in sustainability, renewable energy, and environmental conservation.</p><br>
                        <p>I am a graduate of Tufts University with a double major in Environmental Science and International Relations, and I'm a student of Bloc's Fullstack Engineering Program.
                        Outside of coding, I love hiking, practicing yoga, reading non-fiction (especially books by Bill Bryson and Michael Pollan), baking breads and sweets, 
                        and playing guitar (mostly classical and Spanish guitar, but also the Grateful Dead and the Beatles).

                                I built this because I own a National Parks Passport, and I wanted to pay tribute to those who work hard to preserve the 490+ national parks and monuments around the country.
                                The National Parks Discover-E-Pass is a program that aims to inspire others to visit and explore national parks.
                                It is a full stack program made with React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and CSS.
                                Feel free to view the client code <a href="https://github.com/craragon77/National-Parks-Passport-Client" target="_blank">here</a> and the server code <a href="https://github.com/craragon77/National-Parks-Passport-Server" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                                Bearfoot is a program designed to find hiking trails near you. Just enter your address, town, zip code, or 
                                coordinates to explore different green spaces anywhere in the United States. I made Bearfoot because people forget that, wherever you are in the United States, you are always close to green space or to the great outdoors, and
                                Bearfoot is perfect for those who love hiking and the outdoors as much as I do. Bearfoot was made with Javascript, jQuery, Restful APIs, HTML5, and CSS.

                                    I made this program after not knowing a single answer in a "Name That Car Logo" category on Jeopardy.
                                    This program is for anyone who is interested in learning more about car logos and how many different brands there really are. Built using Javascript, jQuery, HTML5, and CSS.
