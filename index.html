                <p>My name is Chris, and I am a full stack web developer. I love coding because of its many fascinating interdisciplinary applications, as it can be applied to any field or discipline to solve many of our problems.
                        I was first exposed to coding after hearing <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/08/09/749938354/episode-932-deep-learning-with-the-elephants" target="_blank"><span>this NPR podcast</span></a> about 
                        how computer science is being used to save elephants, and since I started learning I have never looked back!
                        I love the rewarding feeling of seeing my programs and apps come alive with the code that I write. Iâ€™m especially interested in front-end website development and how to visually represent complex concepts or data.</p><br>
                        <p>I am a graduate of Tufts University with a double major in Environmental Science and International Relations.
                        Outside of coding, I love hiking, yoga, reading non-fiction (especially books by Bill Bryson and Michael Pollan), baking breads and sweets, 
                        and playing guitar (I mostly play classical, but I also love the Grateful Dead and the Beatles).
